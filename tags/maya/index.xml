      <description>A while ago I wanted to create a simple 2D &amp;ldquo;cut-out&amp;rdquo; animation, just a few images imported and assigned on a planes. Unfortunately, Maya did not had this functionally built in. Doing this by hand requires you to:
 Create a File Texture Create some material and assign the texture as diffuse colour and alpha Create a plane with correct width/height ratio Modify the UV channel Assign the previously created material to the plane  And on top of that you&amp;rsquo;ve got to do it for every single image that you want to use.</description>
