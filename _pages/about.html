Although I identify myself as a game programmer, I currently work fulltime in a company that develops VFX and ArchVis tools.</br>
I do a lot of coding at home, trying to develop a 3D logic/puzzle game using my own technology writtern mostly in C++.</br></br>
The main reason why I wanted to start a blog, is to share my experiences with the various programming problems that I encounter.</br></br>

Here is a short list of some of the thechnologies that I use: </br>
C++, Direct3D, OpenGL, flex/bison, FbxSDK, ASSIMP, Lua, Bullet Physics
