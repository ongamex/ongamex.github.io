      <description>A few days ago I wrote a simple alternative to std::any. It is heavily inspired by Sean Parent&amp;rsquo;s talk Better Code: Runtime Polymorphism.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what std::any is, basically it is a type that can hold data form any type, while maintaining the value semantics.
With C++11 this is really easily done in just a few lines. I&amp;rsquo;m still unsure how and where can I use it.
// &amp;quot;struct object&amp;quot; is the magic type.</description>

      <title>C&#43;&#43; reflection/introspection system</title>

      <description>Why do I need this? &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As some of you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m writing a game in my spare time. In order to make the level/game editor usable, I have to be able to quickly display and edit values. Doing the UI/Serialization/UndoRedo by hand for every type is just too much. The solution to that problem is usually some kind of reflection or introspection system.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Unfortunately C++ does not have a built in solution.</description>

      <title>2D Animation In Maya: Import images as planes</title>

      <description>A while ago I wanted to create a simple 2D &amp;ldquo;cut-out&amp;rdquo; animation, just a few images imported and assigned on a planes. Unfortunately, Maya did not had this functionally built in. Doing this by hand requires you to:
 Create a File Texture Create some material and assign the texture as diffuse colour and alpha Create a plane with correct width/height ratio Modify the UV channel Assign the previously created material to the plane  And on top of that you&amp;rsquo;ve got to do it for every single image that you want to use.</description>

      <description>This is a set of some code snippets that you might find useful.
The 1st one is pretty popular, but I use it in the snippets below. Basically it is
A way to retrieve the size of a C++ array. template &amp;lt;typename T, size_t N&amp;gt; char (&amp;amp;TArrSize_Safe(T (&amp;amp;)[N]))[N]; #define ARRSZ(A) (sizeof(TArrSize_Safe(A))) // Usage int myArray[1234]; printf(&amp;quot;myArray has %d elements!&amp;quot; ARRSZ(myArray));  printf style std::string formatting: // The caller is EXPECTED to call va_end on the va_list args inline void string_format(std::string&amp;amp; retval, const char* const fmt_str, va_list args) { // [CAUTION] // Under Windows with msvc it is fine to call va_start once and then use the va_list multiple times.</description>
